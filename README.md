# samaritans

A front end app with json file mimed back end to display volunteering opportunities made during a 24 hour hackathon with myself and 3 others during our BrainStation web development bootcamp.

To view, clone repository into a new folder on your computer, cd into that folder in from the command line and run '$ npm install ' to install all node dependencies. Once that is complete you can enter the command '$ npm start ' and your browser should load the page. 

When we find a moment we intend to gain access to a public but restricted updated api of current volunteer opportunities and make the site live. 

Thank you for your interest.
