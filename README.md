# samaritans

A front end app with json file mimed back end to display volunteering opportunities made during a 24 hour hackathon with myself and 3 others during our BrainStation web development bootcamp.

To view, clone repository to your computer, then in command line cd into the newly formed "samaritans" folder, then into the client folder and run '$ npm install ' to install all node dependencies. Do the same command in the server folder. Once those are complete, enter the command '$ npm start ' in each the server folder and client folder and your browser should load the page. 

When we find a moment we intend to gain access to a public but restricted updated api of current volunteer opportunities and make the site live. 

Thank you for your interest.
